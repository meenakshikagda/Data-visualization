This README provides a guide to the contents of the CSV
(comma-separated value) files containing annotations for 
Affymetrix WT Gene Array probe sets and transcript clusters.

The CSV files contain both design-time information as well as NetAffx
assignments between probe sets and public mRNA sequences (cDNAs) and
other annotations associated with these sequences. These files are
suitable for use with MS Excel and as input to the Affymetrix Expression
Console software package.

I. General Notes
-----------------

I.A. Informative header

   The CSV file contains an informative header consisting of a set of
   key=value attributes describing the data within the file. This
   includes details about the array design and the NetAffx release on
   which the data in the file are based. The keys do not contain
   spaces, but the values may.

   For compatibility with Affymetrix Expression Console software (EC), 
   each attribute-containing line of the informative header starts with 
   '#%' while descriptive comment lines of the header start with '##'.

   The first non-commented row of the CSV file is a column header,
   containing the primary column titles.

   Description of header keys:

   General information:
      create_date     - date the CSV file was created
      chip_type       - offical designation of the chip (a.k.a. array_type)
      lib_set_name    - array name portion of library file name
      lib_set_version - array version portion of library file name

                                                   pages by identifier (ps/ec/tc/rna)

I.B. File format conventions

   The CSV files follow the conventions of other NetAffx tabular data
   files as described at:
   
   http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/taf_manual.affx
   
   CSV files for WT arrays are a bit more complex than for the
   traditional 3'-IVT type Affymetrix expression arrays described at
   the above URL, owing to additional design-time information and
   increased multiplicity of public mRNA assignments per probe set and
   per transcript cluster.
   
   A given column within the gene array CSV file may contain
   single-valued or multi-valued data. In general, the design-time data
   is single-valued while the mRNA assignment information is
   multi-valued, because multiple public mRNAs may be assigned to a
   given probe set or transcript cluster. Furthermore, a given mRNA may
   contain multiple annotations of a given type (e.g., alternative gene
   names, GO biological process IDs, Pfam domains, etc.). Finally, each
   annotation may contain more than one type of data (e.g., each
   associated gene contains gene symbol, cytogenetic location,
   description, Entrez Gene ID). 
 
   This set of hierarchical, many-to-one relationships
   is encoded in the CSV files using the following conventions. 
   Within each column value, two types of field delimiters may appear:
   
      * " /// " - separates annotations for different mRNAs and also
                  separates multiple annotations of a particular type
                  for a given mRNA. The mRNA to which the annotation
                  applies is identified by the first data type
                  sub-field of the annotation.

      * " // "  - separates different data type sub-fields for a
                  single mRNA annotation
   
   Note that the spaces surrounding the forward slashes are
   considered part of the delimiter.
    
   An empty value (null) is indicated by three hyphens "---".
      
   Here's an example to illustrate:

   The probe set ID 3917874 has been assigned to several public
   mRNAs. Two of these are described in the mrna_assignment column of
   the probe set CSV file as follows:

               Probe set mrna_assignment column value
   _______________________________|_____________________________
   |                                                           |
  "NM_000454 // chr21 // 100 /// ENST00000270142 // chr21 // 100"
   |_______|    |___|    |_|     |_____________|    |___|    |_|
       |          |       |             |             |       |
   accession    chrm    score       accession        chrm   score
   |_________________________|   |______________________________|
                |                               |
        assigned mRNA #1                 assigned mRNA #2
   
   In both the probe set and transcript cluster CSV files, the
   mrna_assignment column lists all assigned public mRNAs, with their
   accessions as the first data type sub-field. Other columns
   containing assigned mRNA annotations will contain data for only
   those mRNAs for which that data are available. The first data type
   sub-field of these other columns will contain the accession of the
   assigned mRNA to which the data for that column apply.

   For example, transcript cluster ID 3917851 (corresponding to the
   probe set in the example above) has eight assigned mRNAs, but only
   one of them is associated with a known gene. So the mrna_assignment
   column for this entry will have data for eight different mRNAs,
   delimited by seven " /// ", and the gene_assignment column will
   have just one mRNA sub-field. The first data type sub-field of the
   mRNA in the gene_assignment column contains the accession of the
   mRNA, listed in the mrna_assignment column, to which the gene
   assignment data applies.
   
I.C.  Array Design Annotation Lifting Pipeline

   Gene array design strategy relies extensively on the complete
   genome assembly for the target organism, aligning public mRNA
   sequences to the genome to determine the location of array
   annotations (transcript clusters, exon clusters, probe sets,
   etc.).

   To make the best assignments between the array sequences and known
   mRNAs, the NetAffx mRNA assignment pipeline (see below) uses the
   most current version of the genome assembly at the time of
   preparation for a NetAffx update. This annotation-time genome
   assembly version is typically different from the genome assembly
   version used during array design, and chromosomal coordinates will
   change between genome assembly versions as the draftier portions of
   the genome are updated. 

   This genome assembly version skew requires the genomic location of
   gene array annotations to be lifted (i.e., transferred) from their
   position on the design-time version of the genome assembly to the
   equivalent position in the annotation-time version of the genome
   used for a NetAffx update. Occasionally in this lifting process,
   some array annotations cannot be transferred cleanly to the new
   genome assembly. More such lifting failures will occur as the
   annotation-time version of the genome improves and diverges from
   the design-time version, but typically such failures are rare,
   ranging from 0.5% (for hg16-to-hg18) up to 4% (for mm5-to-mm8) of
   design-time probe sets not being lifted.

   Genome assembly versions for array design time and NetAffx
   annotation time are indicated at the top of this readme file as
   well as in the header portion of the CSV files (section I.A).

   Lifting of gene array annotation genome coordinates was performed
   using the command-line version of Jim Kent's LiftOver tool
   (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver) with default parameters
   and processing GFF-formatted gene array design data files. The
   liftOver output was post-processed to filter out probe set regions
   (PSRs), and all constituent probe sets and probes, that were not
   cleanly lifted.

   The genomic location data reported in the CSV files is for the
   NetAffx annotation-time version of the genome assembly.  These
   reported genomic location may be different from the location in the
   genome assembly version used at the time of array design for the
   reasons described above. The design-time genome locations of gene
   array annotations can be obtained from viewing the "Design
   Information" section of the NetAffx details web pages.

I.D. mRNA Assignment Pipeline
  
   Assignments to public mRNA were generated by the NetAffx annotation
   sequence analysis pipeline. Public mRNAs used for assignments came
   from Genbank, RefSeq, and Ensembl and include non-coding RNA
   transcripts as well (all public transcripts are collectively
   refered to in this document as 'mRNA' since that constitutes the
   bulk of these transcripts). To reduce redundancy, Genbank and
   RefSeq mRNA sequences were clustered together into groups sharing
   97% identity and 97% alignment overlap. All RefSeq entries or the
   longest Genbank sequence were selected as representatives from each
   cluster. Ensembl sequences were not clustered.

   Three types of sequence alignments are performed as part of the
   NetAffx annotation pipeline: probe-vs-mRNA, mRNA-vs-genome, and
   mRNA-vs-mRNA (for non-redundant mRNA clustering).  All sequence
   alignments used Jim Kent's BLAT software v.29
   (http://www.genomeblat.com) with the following command-line
   options:

     Alignment Type             BLAT command-line options               
     --------------     ----------------------------------------
     probe-vs-mRNA      -minMatch=1                             
     mRNA-vs-genome     -mask=lower -qMask=upper -t=dna -q=rna  
     mRNA-vs-mRNA       -tileSize=12 -minMatch=4 -maxGap=0

   Probe-vs-mRNA alignments were filtered to remove alignments with
   any mismatches, so all 25 bases of each probe were required to
   align to their target mRNAs. Also, only sense strand mRNA
   hits are reported. 

   The same non-redundant public mRNA library, constructed as
   described above, was used to annotate all Affymetrix expression
   arrays, including WT and 3' IVT arrays. The specific steps
   involved in scoring mRNA assignments for WT arrays are different
   from those used for 3' IVT expression arrays. A whitepaper
   describing the 3' IVT assignment pipeline is available here:

   http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=netaffx

   The majority of probe sets and transcript clusters do not have
   public mRNA assignments, since many are based on single-EST or gene
   predictor evidence that are not included in the set of public mRNAs
   used for NetAffx mRNA assignments.

   Details of the NetAffx WT array mRNA assignment pipeline along
   with additional statistics will be described in a separate
   document.

   I.D.1. Ranking of mRNA Assignments

      When a given probe set or transcript cluster is assigned to
      multiple mRNAs, these assignments ranked using a classification
      system that takes into account the nature of each mRNA's data
      source and quality of its annotation. Assigments are further
      ranked by the strength of the assignment score described below.
   
      Details of the public mRNA classification system will be
      described in a forthcoming document. For a brief example:
      RefSeq mRNAs that are reviewed or validated are ranked higher
      than RefSeq provisional mRNAs; GenBank complete CDS records are
      ranked above those that lack that annotation; Ensembl known-ccds
      are ranked above known or novels which are above gene
      predictions. Also, any mRNA with an associated gene name is
      ranked above those lacking a known gene name.
   
      Assignments are initially ranked according to the mRNA
      classification system. Assignments to mRNAs with equivalent
      classification are further ranked according to assignment
      scoring parameters (see below).
     
   I.D.2. Assignment Scoring

      The scoring strategy, and the public mRNA assignment
      pipeline in general, takes advantage of the genome-based nature
      of the Gene Array design: Every probe, probe set, exon cluster,
      and transcript cluster has a unique genomic location.

      Each assignment between a public mRNA and a transcript cluster
      or probe set is assigned a score based on the number of probes
      that could be aligned directly to the mRNA relative to the
      amount that could potentially have aligned.  When a given mRNA
      is aligned to the genome, it may span only a portion of the
      probe set or transcript cluster. To get the number of probes
      that could potentially align to the mRNA, we consider only those
      probes whose genomic locations are within the region of the mRNA
      as it aligns to the genome. The maximum assignment score is 100,
      indicating all possible probes align to the mRNA. Assignments to
      mRNA's that did not have a high-quality alignment to the genome
      are analyzed using an alternative but analogous approach
      (see "Recovery of Unaligned mRNAs" below).

      Assignments for transcript clusters are also given a coverage
      score which is a rough measure of how much of the transcript
      cluster is covered by the mRNA in a genomic alignment. Coverage
      is computed by taking the total number of probes that could
      potentially align to the mRNA based on the mRNA-to-genome
      alignment, relative to the total number of probes in the
      transcript cluster. The maximum coverage score is 100,
      indicating that all probes in the transcript cluster could
      potentially align to the mRNA.
      
      So, to summarize:
                           # probes directly aligned
       assignment score =  -------------------------    x 100
                           # probes potentially aligned

                                
                           # probes potentially aligned
         coverage score =  --------------------------   x 100
                           # probes total in TC

   I.D.3. Recovery of Unaligned mRNAs

      Some fraction of potentially valid mRNAs and non-coding RNAs
      cannot not be cleanly aligned to the repeat-masked genome that
      is used in the NetAffx annotation pipeline. A number of these
      RNAs were included in the array design and thus transcript
      clusters and probe sets based on them would not be annotatable
      using a completely genome-based annotation pipeline. The
      procedure for computing the assignment and coverage scores for
      assignments to these RNAs is not the same as for the other
      genome-alignable RNAs, but follows an analogous procedure.

      The difference is in how the number of probes potentially
      aligning to the non-genome-aligned mRNA is determined
      (denominator of the assignment score and numerator of the
      coverage score). Transcript cluster sequences (consisting of
      spliced exon cluster sequences sans introns) are aligned against
      all organism-specific mRNAs using BLAST. Probe locations within
      the transcript cluster sequences are determined and then
      compared with the location of the mRNA alignment blocks on the
      transcript cluster sequences.

      Other than this alternative method for determining the number of
      potentially aligning probes, the recovery pipeline is identical
      to the genome-based annotation pipeline.

   I.D.4. Cross-hybridization Assessment

      Weak mRNA assignments that are likely due to cross-hybridization
      are assessed by examining the assignment score of transcript
      clusters assigned to mRNAs which could be aligned to the
      genome. If the assignment score is less than 50, the assignment
      is flagged as a crosshyb. It is indicated as the assignment xhyb
      subfield of the mrna_assignment column of the CSV files (see
      sections II.B.11 and III.B.9).

      This crosshyb assessment is first applied at the transcript
      cluster level and then propagated down to the constituent exon
      cluster and probe set levels for all exon clusters and probe
      sets within this transcript cluster that align to the mRNA in
      question. 

      A different crosshyb analysis is performed during array design time
      at the level of the probe set, based on sequence alignments
      between each probe and all other potentially transcribed array
      content. This is indicated in the crosshyb_type field of the
      probe set CSV file (section II.B.12 for more information).

      The key difference between these two crosshyb assessments is
      that the assignment xhyb field is performed at NetAffx
      annotation time using an updated set of known and predicted
      mRNAs, while the probe set crosshyb_type setting is determined
      using all known and predicted transcripts at the time of array
      design, which likely differ from the set used for the NetAffx
      annotation update.

      Another important difference is that the assignment xhyb field
      is mainly an indictor of weak assignment between a transcript
      cluster and the assigned mRNA, suggesting a potential crosshyb,
      whereas the probe set crosshyb_type field is a measure of the
      promiscuity of the probes within a probe set among transcribed
      sequences.

      The design-time probe set crosshyb_type is probably a more
      stringent measure of cross-hybridization potential since it
      involved a larger set of potentially transcribed sequences than
      were used for the NetAffx annotation update (more gene
      predictions and single ESTs). The only caveat here is that it is
      based on data known at array design time and is not updated with
      new NetAffx annotation releases.

                                different from the design-time seqname
                                (column #2) if probes in this probe

                                CSV annotation section). A null
                                value occurs for mRNAs that could not
                                be aligned to the genome.
        f. assignment xhyb      - boolean indicator for whether this

                                cross-hyb calling criteria 
                                are described in section I.D.4.

   II.B.12. crosshyb_type   (integer)

       Cross-hybridization potential of the probe set determined at
       the time of array design. This field is based on
       computational sequence alignment against all known and
       putatively transcribed array design content, which includes all
       potentially transcribed regions of the genome and other
       transcribed sequences that could not be mapped to the
       genome. This field has one of three possible values:

          1 = unique    - All probes in the probe set perfectly match
                          only one sequence in the putatively
                          transcribed array design content. The vast
                          majority (>80%) of probe sets are unique.  

          2 = similar   - All the probes in the probe set perfectly
                          match more than one sequence in the
                          putatively transcribed array design content.

          3 = mixed     - The probes in the probe set either perfectly match or
                          partially match more than one sequence in
                          the putatively transcribed array design content. 

       ** Note that these definitions for probeset type are relative to
          exon and gene array designs and may not be true for other
          types of designs.

          See section I.D.4. for general information about crosshyb
          assessment. 

   II.B.13. number_independent_probes  (integer)

       Number of probes within probe set that overlaps no more than 13
       bases with another probe in the set. (Note that two probes
       that overlap more than 13 bases are counted as one.)

   II.B.14. number_cross_hyb_probes  (integer)

       Number of probe within probe set that align to more than one
       genomic location.

   II.B.15. number_nonoverlapping_probes  (integer)

       Number of probe within probe set that do not overlap another probe.
       (Note that a set of overlapping probes will be counted as 1.)

   II.B.16. level

       Level of design-time annotation support for the probe set.
      
       Possible values:
         Core     - Supported by RefSeq and full-length GenBank
                    transcripts with complete CDS information.
         Extended - Other cDNA support (ESTs, partial mRNAs, syntenic
                    human and mouse mRNAs), Ensembl support, Vega
                    or VegaPseudogene support.
         Full     - Supported by gene predictions only (ie GENSCAN,
                    GENSCAN Suboptimal, SgpGene, geneid, exoniphy,
                    RNAgene, TWINSCAN).  
         Free     - Designed against annotations which were merged
                    such that no single annotation (or evidence) contains the
                    probeset. 
         Ambiguous - Cannot be unambiguously assigned to a particular
                     transcript cluster. 


   II.B.17. bounded   (boolean)

       Probesets are grouped into transcript clusters based on 
       spliced annotations which share splice sites and single
       exons which have overlapping exonic sequence. Remaining
       single exon content may be grouped into a transcript
       cluster if it is bounded by it (ie falls within an intron).
       This flag indicates such inclusion by bounding. Bounded
       probesets have lower confidence of correct transcript cluster
       placement.

   II.B.18. NoBoundedEvidence  (boolean)

       Indicates probesets which are not fully contained within any single
       annotation. For example, two EST sequences aligned to the genome
       may infer the following single exon transcribed region:

          ================================================== Genome

               ----------------   EST 1
                         -----------------  EST 2

       The result may have been a probe selection region (PSR) and probeset
       as follows:

               ---------------------------  PSR
                  --    --  --         --   Probes

       The result is that neither EST fully contains this probeset. Hence
       no annotations (ie ESTs in this case) are associated with the probeset.

   II.B.19. has_cds  (boolean)

       Indicates whether or not the probe set falls within a coding
       sequence of a design-time annotation.

                                different from the design-time seqname
                                (column #2) if probes in this
